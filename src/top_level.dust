    {! iOS Safari treats the position:fixed sidebar very weirdly at non-default zoom levels,
       so just disable zooming for now. It looks good on an iPad, but on an iPhone the text
       is unreadably small. Allowing zoom wouldn't help though, because of the weird
       position:fixed behaviour. If we want to support iPhone that'll need design thinking. !}
